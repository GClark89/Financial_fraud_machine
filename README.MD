# Fraud Detection Analysis and Prediction :mag:

Welocome to the Fraud Analysis and Prediction project :rocket: We will be looking into a large data set and with using 
machine learning figure out what accounts are fraud or not. Dive in to explore the data, modeling process and key findings.

## Modules/Libaries
* Pandas
* Seaborn
* Numpy 
* MatplotLib
* Scikit-learn

#We will take a look at our Financial Data Set and give a few insights and points and draw a hypothesis given what we've looked at...

* Step: A unit of time that represents hours in the data. Think of this as the timestamp of the transaction (e.g hour 1, hour 2....hour 534, ...)

* Type: The type of transaction 

* Amount: The amount of money transferred 

* NameOrig: The origin account name 

* OldBalanceorg: The origin accounts balance before the transaction

* NewBalanceDest: The destination accounts balance after the transaction 

* IsFlaggedfraud: A "Naive" model that simply flags a transaction as fraudulent if it is greater than 200,000 (not that this currency is not USD)

* IsFraud: Was this simulated transaction actually fradulent? In this case, we condier "fraud" to be malicious transaction that aimed to transfer funds out of a victim's bank
account before the account owener could secure their information.
